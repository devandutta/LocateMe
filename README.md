# LocateMe
My first Swift Maps app

This is the first Swift app I have ever written.  The app served as an introduction to the Swift language, to the Storyboard editor in Xcode, and to the MapKit framework.

The app will track your current location to display how far you have gone from the starting point (from when you opened the app).  There are also other useful utility values displayed, such as horizontal accuracy and speed.

Throughout the code, I have placed a lot of comments, detailing certain items I researched while building the app (including the relevant Apple Documentation pages on language constructs and CoreLocation), as well as certain areas that can be improved by using alternate implementations.

Currently, the app does not use the highest accuracy setting available because it causes a large battery drain when not connected to power.
