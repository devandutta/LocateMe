    If previousPoint is "nil" and used in an "if condition", that code block is skipped
    
    Otherwise, we use the value of previousPoint and the value of previousPoint will be assigned to the constant

        An alternate implementation of speed that seems to yield nan (not a number) for speed (I'm currently debugging it):

        To calculate the speed, I will take the distance from the newLocation to the previousPoint
        Then I will divide that distance by the time interval between the newLocation timestamp and the previousPoint timestamp
        This equation is: speed = distance/time
        
        
        NOTE: distanceFromLocation works as follows: 
        "Returns the distance (in meters) from the receiverâs location to the specified location...by tracing a line between them that follows the curvature of the Earth. The resulting arc is a smooth curve and does not take into account specific altitude changes between the two locations."
